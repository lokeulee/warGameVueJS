# warGameVueJS

This is my first VueJS project to get me started on understanding basic fundamentals on what I need.

1. First I downloaded Vue through yarn
   yarn global add @vue/cli
2. We then need to create our own project with vue
   vue create <Project-name>
3. In order to run the project, just cd to the <Project-name> folder that has been created. Then just yarn serve to boot the frontend server.
   cd <Project-name>
   yarn serve.
4. Enjoy !

Challenges of the project.
1. I have only used ReactJS so far which made me had a huge hurdle understanding the syntax.
2. It was pretty alien for me that I would need to code all my functions into a <script> derivative as ReactJS doesn't have that
3. The function that I could just insert it using special directives in Vue is also eye opening.

Thing to improve upon.
1. Better understanding and usage of the Vue special directives that Vue has to offer.
2. Understanding the proper conventions of splitting the code to numerous files. I need more time to learn this and this project was done only in App.vue.
3. Best practices on starting a VueJS project and maybe learn about options API too.
